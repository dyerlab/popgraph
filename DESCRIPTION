Description: This is a generic package that produces "Population Graphs"
    a graph-theoretic topology based upon conditional genetic covariance.  This
    functionality used to be within the gstudio package, but has been taken out
    to focus on spatial integration of graph topologies with existing packages
    like sp, raster, and ggplot2.
